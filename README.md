# üöó Used Car Listings Analysis - CarDekho Dashboard

**Project Category**: Exploratory Data Analysis  
**Tools & Technologies Used**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau

---

## üåê Introduction

This project explores a dataset of used car listings from a car buy/sell platform similar to CarDekho. The objective is to uncover patterns and insights that influence car pricing and demand in the second-hand market. The goal is to build a Tableau dashboard that presents these findings in a clean, actionable, and interactive way for business stakeholders, analysts, and product teams.

### Key Business Questions:
- Which features (e.g., mileage, power, brand) influence selling price?
- Which price ranges and car types dominate the used car market?
- Which brands and configurations are most in demand?

## üìú Project Overview

### Dataset Summary:
- **Source:** Provided internally, resembling CarDekho listings  
- **Dataset:** [üìÑ Download Dataset (CSV)](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1N-G-2hXr-2ZFpP0yKQHHEi6ho58HTAqo) 
- **Size:** 8,128 records, 13 features  
- **Features include:**
  - Car name, year, selling price, km driven
  - Fuel type, seller type, transmission, ownership
  - Mileage, engine size, power, torque, and seats

### Main Analysis Steps:
1. Data Loading & Inspection (via Pandas)
2. Data Cleaning & Transformation
3. Feature Extraction (brand & model)
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Export to Tableau
6. Dashboard design and storytelling

## üîç Data Exploration

### Cleaning & Preprocessing:
- Removed units from `mileage`, `engine`, `max_power` columns
- Converted them to numeric (float)
- Imputed missing values (mode for categorical, median for numeric)
- Extracted `brand_name` and `model_name` from the `name` column
- Cleaned inconsistent text entries in the `owner` column

### Null Values (Before Cleaning):
- `mileage`, `engine`, `max_power`, `torque`, and `seats` had missing values
- Most entries were imputed successfully or dropped if unresolvable

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Analysis Methods

### Techniques Used:
- Summary statistics & distributions (mean, median, etc.)
- Aggregations & group-by analysis (brand-level, fuel-level, etc.)
- Correlation plots (scatterplots with trendlines)
- Visual analysis via Tableau

### Why These Methods?
- Understand demand patterns (count, average prices)
- Explore relationships (mileage vs. price, power vs. price)
- Simplify insights for business presentation

---

## üìä Results and Interpretation

### Key Findings:
- **Maruti Suzuki** is the most listed brand, indicating strong resale presence
- **‚Çπ3L‚Äì6L** is the most common price range
- **Diesel** is the most preferred fuel type in the dataset
- **Manual transmission** dominates listings but **automatic** variants command higher average prices
- **Power (bhp)** shows a stronger correlation with price than **mileage**

### Feature-Price Trends:
- Scatterplot shows that more powerful cars generally have higher resale prices
- Mileage shows a weaker correlation, suggesting other factors dominate

---

## üöÄ Conclusion

This analysis reveals:
- Price clusters between ‚Çπ3‚Äì10L and among brands like Maruti and Hyundai
- Feature-driven insights that can improve pricing algorithms and buyer targeting
- Fuel and transmission preferences that impact car value perception

The final Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive, visual tool to explore these dynamics interactively.

## üîÆ Recommendations

Based on the analysis and dashboard insights, the following actions are recommended for business teams:

1. **Inventory Focus:**
   - Prioritize stock procurement from top-performing brands like Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai.
   - Concentrate listings in the ‚Çπ3L‚Äì6L and ‚Çπ6L‚Äì10L price brackets.

2. **Targeted Marketing:**
   - Promote automatic variants for higher margins, especially in urban areas.
   - Highlight engine power in premium listings to attract value-conscious buyers.

3. **User Experience & Filtering:**
   - Enhance filtering features on platforms based on brand, power, and fuel type.
   - Introduce recommendation engines prioritizing price-power combinations.

4. **Pricing Strategy:**
   - Refine price prediction models to include max power, brand, ownership history, and transmission.
   - Create tiered pricing based on power ratings and feature combinations.

5. **Expansion Considerations:**
   - Explore strategic promotion of less common but emerging segments (e.g., automatic diesel).
   - Track future demand shifts based on power and transmission trends.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations:
- No geographical data to analyze regional trends
- Torque values were too inconsistent to clean
- No timestamps to track price changes over time

### Future Work:
- Add `location`, `listing date`, and `service history` to enrich analysis
- Build a predictive model for price estimation
- Add demand-side behavior data (e.g., buyer clicks or inquiries)
